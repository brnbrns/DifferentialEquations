# Differential Equations

This repository contains python code for solving differential equations.

## secondOrder.py
Solves differential equations of the form:
```
ay'' + by' + cy = 0
```

## system.py
Solves a system of differential equations of the form:
```
x' = ax + by
y' = cx + dy
```
system.py utilizes the sympy library, which can be easily installed using pip.
To install sympy so that system.py will run, run the following commands from a terminal or command line:
```
pip install mpmath
pip install sympy
```
system.py will then be interpreted correctly.
